#VENDING MACHINE

 The project is about simulating the working principle of Vending Machine.

 This gives a brief idea , how the vending machine works and comes to know how user-friendly it is. 
 Here, in this project we will be taking the required inputs from the user
 and accordingly move forward for the further steps. 
 And at the end, user will be displayed with the total earnings for the day and balance in the machine. 
 Suppose after taking the inputs from the user like product code, the quantity and 
 the amount  we will display him with the information according to the inputs.
 So, this is how it works . HOPE YOU ALL GOT IT!
                   THANK YOU:)
